# Welcome to Spot Canvas - Professional Crypto Charting Awaits!

Hi there,

Welcome to Spot Canvas! We're thrilled to have you join our growing community of crypto traders and investors.

## What is Spot Canvas?

Spot Canvas is a professional cryptocurrency charting platform built by crypto natives, for crypto natives. We're not just another trading view clone - we're building something different.

**🔗 Crypto-Native Platform** - Designed specifically for cryptocurrency markets. We're integrating directly with blockchains to bring on-chain data into your charts - whale movements, network activity, and DeFi metrics alongside price action.

**🛠️ Developer-Friendly & Customizable** - Built with extensibility at its core. Create your own custom indicators using Python, automate your analysis workflows, and integrate with your existing tools through our upcoming API.

**📊 Multi-Chart Layouts** - Monitor multiple markets simultaneously with our flexible, fully customizable layout system. Save unlimited configurations and switch between them instantly.

**⚙️ Scriptable Indicators** - Go beyond pre-built indicators. Write your own custom technical analysis tools in Python to match your unique trading strategy. Share them with the community or keep them private.

**⚡ Real-Time Everything** - WebSocket-powered live data for all major pairs, instant chart updates, and cloud-synced settings across all your devices.

What truly sets us apart? We're building a platform that speaks the language of crypto. No legacy baggage, no traditional market limitations - just pure focus on what crypto traders and developers actually need.
