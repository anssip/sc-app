# Saved Layouts

Users need to be able to save their chart layouts.

## Feature description

Users need to be able to name the layout and later on retrieve any of the saved layouts by name.

Following things will be saved:

- the layout itself (how many charts and in which order)
- the dimensions of each chart
- the layout name
- selections made for each of the charts: active indicators, symbol, time granularity
- filters applied to each of the charts
