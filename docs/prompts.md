# Toolbar & header

Let's add header and toolbar components that will be shown on top of every chart in ChartPanel. These will include:

- symbol selector
- granularity selector
- chart deletion button
- buttons to split the panel vertically and horizontally

Let's leave the buttons be dummy for now and not implement the actual splitting functionality – that will follow.

Help me implement the header component and the toolbar component that will be contained in the header.

# Repository

My next step in developing this Chart App is to implement the data services strategy. First let's create the TypeScript types and the Repository service. The Repository will then be used from the react components to load the chart layout and to create and save new layouts. The layout management features will be the first feature to implement in the Repository.
