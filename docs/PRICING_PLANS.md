# Onboarding to Pricing Plans

During launch, there will be two plans:

1. Starter
2. Pro

Pricing page mentions the Enterprice plan but that it is not available yet. Coming in the future.

1. Signup + Payment Info

    Let the user create an account and enter payment details without selecting a plan yet.

    Clearly state:

        “Start your 7-day free trial of the Pro plan (full access). You’ll choose your plan before the trial ends.”

2. During Trial

    Give access to everything in the top plan.

    Use in-app plan reminders or nudges:

        - "You're currently on a trial of the Pro plan."
        - "Your trial ends in 4 days. Choose the plan that’s right for you to continue, or continue with the Pro plan."

3. Day 6 or 7 (End of Trial)

    Prompt the user to select their plan:

        - Highlight differences clearly.
        - Pre-select the mid-tier plan (if that’s your target sweet spot).
        - Make it easy to downgrade or stick with Pro.

    If they don’t choose a plan, default to:

        - Charge for the Pro plan

4. After Trial Ends

    - Start billing based on selected plan.
    - If no plan is selected, send a grace period reminder (1–2 days).
