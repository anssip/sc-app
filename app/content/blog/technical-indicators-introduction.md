We're stoked to unveil the biggest upgrade yet to Spot Canvas - a full toolbox of technical indicators for our upcoming charting product. These indicators are for all charting pros and also for all newbies in this area. These new tools will help you spot trends, catch reversals, and trade with more confidence.

## What's New

Our technical indicators suite includes all the essential tools you need for comprehensive market analysis:

- **Moving Averages** - Simple, Exponential, and Weighted moving averages to identify trends

- **Volume Indicators** - Volume analysis tools to confirm price movements
- **Volatility Indicators** - Bollinger Bands, ATR, and other volatility measures

## Why Technical Indicators Matter

Technical indicators are mathematical calculations based on price, volume, or open interest data. They help traders:

- Identify potential entry and exit points
- Confirm trend direction and strength
- Spot potential reversals before they happen
- Manage risk more effectively
- Remove emotion from trading decisions

## Getting Started

- Customizable parameters and settings
- Clear visual representations on your charts
- Educational tooltips and explanations

We believe that powerful analysis tools shouldn't be complicated to use. That's why we've focused on creating an interface that makes technical analysis accessible to everyone, while still providing the depth that professional traders demand.

## Popular Indicators Explained

### Moving Averages
Moving averages smooth out price action to help identify trends. The Simple Moving Average (SMA) calculates the average price over a specific period, while the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) gives more weight to recent prices, making it more responsive to new information.

### RSI (Relative Strength Index)
The RSI measures momentum and helps identify overbought or oversold conditions. Values above 70 typically indicate overbought conditions, while values below 30 suggest oversold conditions.

### MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
MACD shows the relationship between two moving averages and helps identify changes in momentum, direction, and duration of a trend. It's particularly useful for spotting potential buy and sell signals.

### Bollinger Bands
These bands expand and contract based on market volatility, helping traders identify potential support and resistance levels, as well as overbought and oversold conditions.

## Advanced Features

### Multi-Timeframe Analysis
View indicators across different timeframes simultaneously to get a comprehensive view of market conditions. This helps you align your trades with both short-term and long-term trends.

### Custom Alerts
Set up alerts based on indicator conditions to never miss a trading opportunity. Get notified when:
- Price crosses a moving average
- RSI enters overbought/oversold territory
- MACD generates a buy/sell signal
- Custom conditions are met

### Backtesting Capabilities
Test your indicator-based strategies against historical data to see how they would have performed. This helps you refine your approach before risking real capital.
