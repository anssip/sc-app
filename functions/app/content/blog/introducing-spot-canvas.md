We are happy to announce the immediate availability of the Spot Canvas service! After a year of intense development we are finally here and we are inviting all traders and crypto enthusiasts to sign up and experience the future of crypto charting.

**But here's what makes us truly different:** While other platforms give you charts and indicators, Spot Canvas gives you an AI-powered trading assistant that understands both your charts and the markets. This isn't just another charting tool – it's your intelligent trading companion powered by AI.

It all builds up on our data services and market evaluation engine which are responsible for driving the presentation layer, the charting tool. The data services provide the real-time market data for all major cryptocurrencies. Combined with our industry-first AI Assistant, you get not just data, but intelligent insights and natural language control over your entire trading workspace.

## What You Can Do Today

### 🤖 AI-Powered Chart Assistant (Industry First!)

This is where Spot Canvas truly shines. Our AI Assistant isn't just a chatbot – it's a sophisticated trading companion that's deeply integrated with your charts and uses real-time market data. Here's what makes it revolutionary:

**Natural Language Chart Control**
Forget clicking through menus. Just type or say what you want:

- "Switch to ETH-USD on the 6-hour timeframe"
- "Enable RSI and Bollinger Bands"
- "Pan the chart to the right"
- "Remove all trend lines from this chart"

**Automated Technical Analysis**
Our AI doesn't just follow commands – it performs professional-grade analysis:

- **Support & Resistance Detection**: Ask for levels and watch as the AI instantly identifies and draws them on your chart with confidence scores
- **Levels classification**: The AI spots spike levels (extreme reversals), swing points, and consolidation zones
- **Trading scenarios**: Once you have the resistance levels plotted on the chart, you can ask the AI to generate trading scenarios based on these levels. It can suggest entry and exit points, stop-loss levels, and potential profit targets.

**Your Personal Trading Mentor**
Learning technical analysis has never been easier:

- Ask "What does the RSI divergence mean?" and get instant, contextual explanations
- "How does this trading volume relate to the identified support and resistance levels?"
- "How would you trade this?" gives you strategic perspectives based on current market conditions

**Real-Time Market Intelligence**
The AI Assistant uses live market data to provide:

- Analysis of current price action and volume patterns
- Identification of key levels that actually matter for your timeframe
- Visual indicators showing strength of support/resistance with line thickness and styles

### Multi-Chart Layout Management

Professional traders need to see the bigger picture. With Spot Canvas, you can monitor multiple markets simultaneously using our flexible layout system. Choose from preset configurations or create your own custom arrangements with resizable panels that adapt to your workflow. Every layout you create is automatically saved and restored when you return.

### Comprehensive Symbol Coverage

Access all major cryptocurrency pairs with real-time data delivered via WebSocket connections. Our symbol manager makes it easy to find and track your favorite pairs, with intelligent search and quick access to frequently traded markets. View data across multiple timeframes, from 15-minute candles for day trading to daily charts for long-term analysis.

### Professional Drawing Tools

Technical analysis requires precision. Our trend line tools allow you to mark support and resistance levels with accuracy, and every drawing is automatically saved to the cloud. Each chart maintains its own set of drawings, so you can build complex analysis across multiple markets without clutter.

### Essential Technical Indicators

We've included the indicators that matter most to crypto traders:

- **Moving Averages** (SMA and EMA) for trend identification
- **Oscillators** including RSI, MACD, and Stochastic for momentum analysis
- **Bollinger Bands** and ATR for volatility measurement
- **Real-time volume tracking** to gauge market participation

Run multiple indicators simultaneously to confirm your trading signals and build comprehensive market analysis.

### Advanced Charting Features

Our charts are built for performance and precision:

- Professional candlestick visualization with real-time updates
- Interactive crosshairs for exact price and time targeting
- Smooth pan and zoom navigation through price history
- Full mobile and tablet touch support
- Fullscreen and full-window modes for immersive analysis
- Canvas-based rendering ensures smooth performance even with multiple indicators

## What is Coming Next?

Now that we have the foundations ready, including our groundbreaking AI Assistant, we're ready to take things even further. Our roadmap focuses on making the AI even more powerful and expanding its capabilities:

### Enhanced AI-Powered Features (2025-2026)

**Advanced Pattern Recognition**
The AI will automatically detect and highlight complex chart patterns like head-and-shoulders, triangles, flags, wedges, and double tops/bottoms – drawing them directly on your charts with explanations.

**Multi-Timeframe AI Analysis**
Our AI will compare signals across different timeframes, telling you when the daily chart is bullish but the hourly is showing weakness – giving you the complete picture at a glance.

**Risk/Reward Analysis**
Ask "If I enter at $2100, where should I set stops?" and the AI will suggest optimal stop-loss and take-profit levels based on current market structure and volatility.

**Strategy Testing with AI**
The AI will run quick backtests of strategies like moving average crossovers on your historical data, providing win rates and profit factors instantly.

**Interactive Tutor Mode**
An "Explain Like I'm 5" feature where the AI becomes your personal trading teacher, walking you through concepts step-by-step with real examples from your current chart.

### Blockchain Data Overlays

We're working on making blockchain data and on-chain events visible directly in your charts. The AI Assistant will interpret this data for you, explaining how whale movements and network activity correlate with price action.

### AI Script Generator

Simply tell the AI "Make me an indicator that highlights RSI divergences" and watch as it writes the code and implements it on your chart. No programming knowledge required.

### And More on the Roadmap:

- **Multi-asset comparison** for correlation analysis
- **Price alerts** with customizable notifications
- **Automatic pattern recognition** for chart patterns
- **Strategy backtesting** on historical data
