We are happy to announce the immediate availability of the Spot Canvas service! After a year of intense development we are finally here and we are inviting all traders and crypto enthusiasts to sign up and start kicking the tyres.

What we have now is what we consider to be the core foundations that will serve our users well. It all builds up on our data services and market evaluation engine which are responsible for driving the presentation layer, the charting tool. The data services provide the real-time market data for all major cryptocurrencies. Also the data that drives the market indicators that you see in the charts is coming from this data layer.

## What You Can Do Today

### Multi-Chart Layout Management
Professional traders need to see the bigger picture. With Spot Canvas, you can monitor multiple markets simultaneously using our flexible layout system. Choose from preset configurations or create your own custom arrangements with resizable panels that adapt to your workflow. Every layout you create is automatically saved and restored when you return.

### Comprehensive Symbol Coverage
Access all major cryptocurrency pairs with real-time data delivered via WebSocket connections. Our symbol manager makes it easy to find and track your favorite pairs, with intelligent search and quick access to frequently traded markets. View data across multiple timeframes, from 15-minute candles for day trading to daily charts for long-term analysis.

### Professional Drawing Tools
Technical analysis requires precision. Our trend line tools allow you to mark support and resistance levels with accuracy, and every drawing is automatically saved to the cloud. Each chart maintains its own set of drawings, so you can build complex analysis across multiple markets without clutter.

### Essential Technical Indicators
We've included the indicators that matter most to crypto traders:
- **Moving Averages** (SMA and EMA) for trend identification
- **Oscillators** including RSI, MACD, and Stochastic for momentum analysis
- **Bollinger Bands** and ATR for volatility measurement
- **Real-time volume tracking** to gauge market participation

Run multiple indicators simultaneously to confirm your trading signals and build comprehensive market analysis.

### Advanced Charting Features
Our charts are built for performance and precision:
- Professional candlestick visualization with real-time updates
- Interactive crosshairs for exact price and time targeting
- Smooth pan and zoom navigation through price history
- Full mobile and tablet touch support
- Fullscreen and full-window modes for immersive analysis
- Canvas-based rendering ensures smooth performance even with multiple indicators

## What is Coming Next?

Now that we have the foundations ready, we are ready to continue with our vision for the product. This vision consists of following elements:

### Blockchain Data Overlays
We're working on making blockchain data and on-chain events visible directly in your charts. Imagine seeing whale movements, significant transfers, and network activity overlaid on price action – bringing a new dimension to technical analysis.

### Programmable Indicators
Create your own custom indicators using Python. Whether you need a specific moving average combination or a completely novel oscillator, you'll have the tools to build it.

### AI-Assisted Insights
Leverage machine learning to identify patterns, generate trade ideas, and receive intelligent alerts based on your trading style and preferences.

### And More on the Roadmap:
- **Multi-asset comparison** for correlation analysis
- **Price alerts** with customizable notifications
- **Automatic pattern recognition** for chart patterns
- **Strategy backtesting** on historical data
- **Export capabilities** for charts and data
- **Custom watchlists** to organize your markets
- **Notes and annotations** for detailed chart analysis
