# Introduction

It's tempting to use React because of the followign reasons:

1. I know React
2. There are powerful React libraries for layout management which is an essential part of this project.

If we do React, then what kind of app this should be be?

Could be Next.js but this does not need server-side rendering, and also Next.js seems a bit too heavy for this project. We could also consider using Remix.run, which is a framework built on top of React that provides a lot of the same benefits as Next.js, but with a smaller footprint and a more flexible architecture.

## Decision

We are going to use Remix.run for our application.
